# patches.g4

## Description

This is the antlr4-compatible EBNF syntax for the patches programming language
project.

## Getting Started

Install [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/) on your system by any means necessary.

This script downloads the jar file necessary to build the bindings.

    npm run getJar

This script runs a tree test of the `./test/test.en.xpl` file.

    npm run tree

If you install the repo locally and have antlr installed correctly, try this:

    npm run gui
